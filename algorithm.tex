\begin{enumerate}
\item Fit model on training set using ensemble method like random
forests.
\item Fit model to test set.  Get estimates for each sample from each
tree.  Calculate mean and variance of each estimate.
\item Construct new y matrix consisting of original y, mean, and
1/variance, which is alpha in Rob's notation.
\item Either estimate lambda from GCV or use Rob's node specific lambda
\end{enumerate}
