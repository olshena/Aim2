\begin{enumerate}
\item Fit model on training set using ensemble method like random
forests.
\item Fit model to test set.  Get estimates for each sample from each
tree.  Calculate mean and variance of each estimate.
\item Construct new y matrix consisting of original y, mean, and
1/variance, which is alpha in Rob's notation.
\item Either estimate $\lambda$ from GCV or use Rob's node specific
  $\lambda$.  The node specific $\lambda$ is $\sigma^2_z/(n
  \bar{\alpha} (c_{\nu}-\hat{\bar{Z}})^2)$.  Estimate $c_{\nu}$ as the
  node specific mean and $\sigma^2_z$ as the node specific variance.
  Then $n$ is the number of samples in the node, $\bar{\alpha}$ is the
  average of the $\alpha$s in the node, where each $\alpha$ is the
  inverse of the variance of the tree predictions, and $\hat{\bar{Z}}$
  is the average of the ensemble estimates in the node.
